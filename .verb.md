See the [wikipedia punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation) article for more details.

## Usage

```js
var punctuation = require('{%= name %}');

// the main export is a function that must be called
console.log(punctuation().test('!'));
//=> true
```

Pass `true` to get a regex for matching the additional "supplemental" characters mentioned in the wikipedia article. 

```js
console.log(punctuation(true).test('â€˜'));
//=> true
```
